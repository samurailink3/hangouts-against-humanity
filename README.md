Hangouts Against Humanity
=========================

"Cards Against Humanity"-like game for Google Plus Hangouts

The eventual goal of this project is to create a javascript framework for this type of card game. The engine will be completely expandable by using a simple JSON file of new cards.

Thanks to Cards Against Humanity for this great CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0 game!
